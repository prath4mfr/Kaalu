    <ul class="timeline">
      <li><strong>9th Grade (2022):</strong> our friendship started in 9th i once asked Saumya why she always wore a mask and ig that started everything.At that time She was friends with Rhythm, Sanya, and Sumehra.</li>
      <li><strong>First iconic Incident 🤪:</strong> She once asked me to draw a drawing for her but I said *“Khud banale”*</li>
      <li><strong>Late 9th:</strong> Slowly, I started approaching her more, got her Snapchat and after lots of convincing, her Instagram too.</li>
